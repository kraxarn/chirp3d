# chirp3d

Modern, lightweight and cross-platform 3D-focused game engine.
Somewhat related to [chirp](https://github.com/kraxarn/chirp),
but with a stronger focus on modern 3D support over supporting every platform in existence.

# status

Currently very early in development and not very usable quite yet.

# features

* No AI slop, all bugs were proudly created by me.

# platform support

* Linux and Android through Vulkan 1.0.
* macOS and iOS through Metal.
* Windows through Direct3D 12 (FL 11_0, RBT 2), or Vulkan 1.0 (not recommended).

# compiler support

Any compiler with C23 support should work, including Clang 19+ (recommended) or GCC 15+.
MSVC is currently not supported, as it doesn't support C23 yet.

# why yet another engine?

It's fun to make and very cool to have your own game engine B)
